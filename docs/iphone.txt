Activating and Setting Up iPhone

1

What You Need

To use iPhone, you need:

A new two-year wireless service plan with AT&T

A Mac or a PC with a USB 2.0 port and one of the following operating systems:

Mac OS X version10.4.10 or later
 
Windows XP Home or Professional with Service Pack 2 or later 
 
Windows Vista Home Premium, Business, Enterprise, or Ultimate edition 

iTunes 7.3 or later, available at www.itunes.com 
 
An iTunes Store account 
 
An Internet connection 

You must be at least 18 years old to open a new AT&T wireless account. You will need a 
major credit card to open a new iTunes Store account. 

Activating iPhone 

Before you can use any of iPhoneï¿½s features, you must activate iPhone by signing up for 
an AT&T service plan and registering iPhone with the network. If you already have an 
AT&T (Cingular) wireless account, you can choose to upgrade your account to work 
with iPhone, or you can keep using your old phone and add a new line for iPhone. 
(Some accounts may not be upgradable.) You can transfer your current phone number 
to iPhone, or get a new one. 

For more information about iPhone, including videos about how to activate and use 
iPhone, go to: 
www.apple.com/iphone 


To activate iPhone: 
1 Download and install iTunes 7.3 (or later) from www.itunes.com. 

2 
Connect iPhone to a USB 2.0 port on your Mac or PC using the dock and cable that 
came with iPhone. (Don't connect iPhone to the USB port on your keyboard - it does 
not have enough power.) iTunes opens automatically. 


3 
Follow the onscreen instructions in iTunes to activate iPhone and sync iPhone with 

your contacts, calendars, email accounts, and bookmarks on your computer. 
A single checkmark in 'Set Up Your iPhone' syncs all these items automatically. Or you 
can use iTunes to customize the information you sync, and to sync your music, photos, 
podcasts, TV shows, and movies to iPhone. See the following section. 


Important: AT&T will send you a welcome text message a few minutes after activation 
is complete, letting you know that you can receive calls. If you are migrating your 
current phone number to iPhone, activation is usually completed in less than 20 
minutes, but may take several hours depending on your previous carrier. In the 
meantime, you can make calls and use iPhone's other features. 


Syncing iPhone with Your Computer 

When you connect iPhone to your computer, iTunes syncs iPhone with the information 
and media on your computer, according to your iPhone settings in iTunes. By default, 
iTunes does this automatically. 


Chapter 1 Activating and Setting Up iPhone 

1
2

4 

You can set iTunes to sync any or all of the following: 

Contacts - names, phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, and so on 
 
Calendars - appointments and events 
 
Email account settings 
 
Webpage bookmarks 
 
Music and audiobooks 
 
Movies 
 
TV shows 
 
Podcasts 
 
Photos 

Because music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, and photos are managed on your 
computer, these items are synced one-way, from your computer to iPhone. Email 
account settings also are only synced from your computer to iPhone. This allows you to 
customize your email account on iPhone without affecting the email account settings 
on your computer. Contacts and calendars are synced both ways between your 
computer and iPhone. New entries or changes you make on iPhone get synced to your 
computer, and vice versa. 

If you like, you can set iPhone to sync with only a portion of what's on your computer. 
For example, you might want to sync only a group of contacts from your address book, 
or only unwatched movies. You can adjust sync settings whenever iPhone is connected 
to your computer. 

Important: You can connect and sync only with one iPhone at a time. If you're using a 
PC, you should be logged in to your own user account on the computer before 
connecting iPhone. If you connect more than one iPhone to the same user account, 
use the same sync settings for each. 

Setting Up Syncing 

You use iTunes on your computer to set up which items are synced with iPhone. 


Set up syncing 

Connect iPhone to your computer, and open iTunes (if it doesn't open automatically). 
Select iPhone in the iTunes Source pane. 
Configure the sync settings in each of the panes. 
Click Apply in the lower-right corner of the screen. 


Chapter 1 Activating and Setting Up iPhone 


The following sections provide an overview of each of the iPhone configuration panes 
in iTunes. For more information, see iTunes Help (in iTunes, choose Help > iTunes Help). 



Summary Pane 

Select 'Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected' to have iTunes sync iPhone 
automatically whenever you connect iPhone to your computer. Deselect this option if 
you want to sync only by clicking the Sync button in iTunes. For more information 
about preventing automatic syncing, see page 9. 

Select 'Only sync checked items' if you want to sync only checked items in your iTunes 
library. 

Info Pane 

The Info pane lets you configure the sync settings for your contacts, calendars, email 
accounts, and web browser. 

Contacts 

You can sync contacts from Mac OS X Address Book and Yahoo! Address Book on a 
Mac, or from Yahoo! Address Book, Windows Address Book (Outlook Express), or 
Microsoft Outlook on a PC. On a Mac, any other address books you've set to sync with 
Address Book, such as Microsoft Entourage, will also be synced with iPhone. If you sync 
with Yahoo! Address Book, you only need to click Configure when you change your 
Yahoo! ID or password after you've set up syncing. Click Configure and enter your new 
login information. 

Note: Syncing won't delete any contact in Yahoo! Address Book that contains a 
Messenger ID, even if you've deleted the contact from your address book on iPhone or 
your computer. To delete a contact with a Messenger ID, log in to your online Yahoo! 
account and delete the contact using Yahoo! Address Book. 

Chapter 1 Activating and Setting Up iPhone 


Calendars 

You can sync calendars from iCal on a Mac, or from Microsoft Outlook on a PC. 
On a Mac, when you sync iCal calendars with iPhone, any other calendars you've set to 
sync with iCal, such as your events and tasks in Microsoft Entourage, will also be synced 
with iPhone. 


Mail Accounts 

You can sync email account settings from Mail on a Mac, or Microsoft Outlook or 
Outlook Express on a PC. Account settings are only transferred from your computer to 
iPhone. Changes you make to an email account on iPhone do not affect the account on 
your computer. 


Note: The password for your Yahoo! email account is not saved on your computer. 
So if you sync a Yahoo! email account, you must enter the password on iPhone. 
From the Home screen choose Settings > Mail, choose your Yahoo! account, then enter 
your password in the password field. 


Web Browser 

You can sync bookmarks from Safari on a Mac, or Safari or Internet Explorer on a PC. 

Advanced 

These options let you replace the information on iPhone with the information on your 
computer during the next sync. 

Music, Podcasts, and Video Panes 

Use these panes to specify the media you want to sync. You can sync all music, 
podcasts, and videos, or select the playlists and specific podcasts and videos you want 
on iPhone. Audiobooks and music videos are synced along with music. 

Photos Pane 

You can sync iPhone with photos in iPhoto 4.0.3 or later on a Mac, or with Adobe 
Photoshop Album 2.0 or later or Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0 or later on a PC. 
Or you can sync with any folder on your computer that contains images. 

Chapter 1 Activating and Setting Up iPhone 


Preventing iPhone from Syncing Automatically 

You may want to prevent iPhone from syncing automatically if you prefer to add items 
to iPhone manually or when you connect iPhone to some other computer than the 
main computer you sync iPhone with. 

Set iTunes not to sync automatically when you connect iPhone 

Connect iPhone to your computer and in iTunes click the Summary tab. Then deselect 
'Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected.' This also prevents iTunes from 
opening automatically when you connect iPhone. You can still start a sync manually. 

Set iTunes to prevent automatic syncing for all iPhones 

In iTunes choose iTunes > Preferences (on a Mac) or Edit > Preferences (on a PC), 
then deselect 'Disable automatic syncing for all iPhones.' 

If this checkbox is selected, iPhone won't sync automatically, even if 'Automatically sync' is selected in the Summary pane. 

Prevent iPhone from syncing automatically one time, without changing any settings 

Open iTunes. Then as you connect iPhone to your computer, press and hold Command-Option (if you're using a Mac) or Shift-Control (if you're using a PC) until you see iPhone 
in the iTunes Source pane. 

Start a sync manually 

Click the Summary tab, then click Sync in the lower-right corner of the window. 
Or, if you've changed any sync settings, click Apply. 

Disconnecting iPhone from Your Computer 

Unless iPhone is syncing with your computer, you can disconnect iPhone from your 

computer at any time. 

When iPhone is syncing with your computer, iPhone shows 'Sync in progress.' If you 
disconnect iPhone before it's done syncing, some data may not have been transferred. 
When iPhone is done syncing, iTunes shows 'iPhone sync is complete.' 

To cancel a sync so you can disconnect iPhone, drag the slider on iPhone. If you get a 
call during a sync, the sync is canceled automatically and you can unplug iPhone to 
answer the call. Connect iPhone after the call to finish syncing.

. 
Connecting to the Internet 

iPhone connects to the Internet automatically whenever you use Mail, Safari, YouTube, 
Stocks, Maps, or Weather. iPhone does the following, in order, until connected: 
 
Connects over the last Wi-Fi 


 
network you used that's available. 
 
If no previously used Wi-Fi networks are available, iPhone shows a list of Wi-Fi 
networks in range. Tap a network and, if necessary, enter the password to join. 
Networks that require a password show - next to them. 
 
If no Wi-Fi networks are available or you choose not to join any, iPhone connects to 
the Internet over EDGE 

If no Wi-Fi networks are available and EDGE is not available, iPhone cannot connect to 
the Internet. Turning on airplane mode disables both Wi-Fi and EDGE. 

Note: Because iPhone uses EDGE for the phone, you cannot use the Internet over EDGE 
when you're on a call. To talk on the phone and use Internet applications at the same 
time, connect over a Wi-Fi network. 

Wi-Fi 

iPhone can join AirPort and other Wi-Fi networks at home, at work, or at Wi-Fi hot spots 
around the world. 

When iPhone is connected to a Wi-Fi network, the Wi-Fi icon 


in the status bar at the 
top of the screen shows connection strength. The more bars you see, the stronger the 
connection. 
 
To see all the Wi-Fi networks in range, from the Home screen choose Settings > Wi-Fi. 
Tap a network to join it. 

Many Wi-Fi networks can be used free of charge, and some require a fee. To join a 
Wi-Fi network at a hot spot where charges apply, in most cases you can open Safari to 
see a webpage that allows you to sign up for service. 

For information about configuring Wi-Fi settings, see 'Wi-Fi' on page 94. 

EDGE 

EDGE allows Internet connectivity over the cellular network, available through AT&T's 
wireless service. Check AT&T's network coverage in your area for availability. 

You can tell iPhone is connected to the Internet over EDGE if you see 


in the status 
bar at the top of the screen. 
If you're outside AT&T's network, you may be able to use EDGE from another carrier. 

Roaming charges may apply. 

Note: While iPhone is actively transferring data over EDGE - downloading a webpage, 
for example - you may not be able to receive calls. Incoming calls may go to voicemail. 

Chapter 2 Basics 


Using iPhone on an Airplane 


Airplane mode disables the wireless features of iPhone to avoid interfering with aircraft 
operation and other electrical equipment. 

From the Home screen choose Settings, then turn airplane mode on. 

When you turn on airplane mode,

 
appears in the status bar at the top of the screen. 
No cell phone, radio, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth signals are emitted from iPhone. You cannot: 
 
Make phone calls 
 
Send or receive email 
 
Browse the Internet 
 
Send or receive text messages 
 
Stream YouTube videos 
 
Get stock quotes 
 
Get maps locations 
 
Get weather reports 


If allowed by the aircraft operator and applicable laws and regulations, you can

Listen to visual voicemail 
 
Check your calendar 
 
Take or view pictures 
 
Hear alarms 
 
Use the stopwatch or timer 
 
Use the calculator 
 
Take notes 
 
Read text messages and email messages stored on iPhone 


Charging the Battery 

iPhone has an internal rechargeable battery. 

Charge the battery 
 
Connect iPhone to a power outlet using the included cable and power adapter. 

Chapter 2 Basics 


Charge the battery and sync iPhone 

Connect iPhone to your computer (not your keyboard) using the included cable 
and dock. 


Note: If iPhone is connected to a computer that's turned off or is in sleep or standby 
mode, the iPhone battery may drain. 
An icon in the upper-right corner of the screen shows battery charging status. 


Charging Charged 
If you charge the battery while syncing or using iPhone, it may take longer to charge. 

Important: If iPhone is very low on power, it shows a message saying 'Please Connect 
to Power' or 'Charging... Please Wait' and needs to charge for up to ten minutes before 
you can use it. If iPhone is extremely low on power, the display may be blank for up to 
two minutes before showing the low-power message. 

Rechargeable batteries have a limited number of charge cycles and may eventually 
need to be replaced. The iPhone battery is not user replaceable; it can only be replaced 
by an authorized service provider. For more information, go to: 
www.apple.com/batteries 

WARNING: For important safety information about charging iPhone, see page 102. 


Cleaning iPhone 

Use the cloth that came with iPhone to gently wipe the glass screen and the case. 

You can also use a soft, slightly damp, lint-free cloth. Unplug and turn off iPhone (press 
and hold the Sleep/Wake button, then drag the onscreen red slider). Avoid getting 
moisture in openings. Don't use window cleaners, household cleaners, aerosol sprays, 
solvents, alcohol, ammonia, or abrasives to clean iPhone.

Tap Mail to send and check email. 



Mail is a rich HTML email client that retrieves your email in the background while you 
do other things on iPhone. iPhone works with the most popular email systems - 
including Yahoo! Mail, Gmail, AOL, and .Mac Mail - as well as most industry-standard 
POP3 and IMAP email systems. Mail lets you send and receive photos and graphics, 
which are displayed in your message along with the text. You can also get PDFs and 
other attachments and view them on iPhone. 

Setting Up Email Accounts 

You must have an email address - which looks like 'yourname@example.com' - to use 
iPhone for email. If you have Internet access, you most likely got an email address from 
your Internet service provider. 

If you chose automatic syncing during setup, your existing email accounts should be 
already set up and ready to go. Otherwise, you can set iTunes to sync your email 
accounts, or configure email accounts directly on iPhone.

Syncing Email Accounts to iPhone 

You use iTunes to sync your email accounts to iPhone. iTunes supports Mail and 
Microsoft Entourage on a Mac, and Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express on a PC. 
See 'Setting Up Syncing' on page 6. 

Note: Syncing an email account to iPhone copies the email account setup, not the 
messages themselves. Whether the messages in your inbox appear on both iPhone and 
your computer depends on the type of email account you have and how it's 
configured. 

If You Don't Have an Email Account 

Email accounts are available from most Internet service providers. If you use a Mac, you 
can get an email address, along with other services, at www.mac.com. Fees may apply. 

Free accounts are also available online: 
 
www.mail.yahoo.com 
Yahoo! provides free 'push' email accounts. With a push email account, email is 
transferred to iPhone as soon as it is received by the mail server.

to appear in a new pop-up page. 

 
To enable or disable plug-ins, turn Plug-ins on or off. Plug-ins allow Safari to display 
some kinds of video. 
 
To set whether Safari accepts cookies, tap Accept Cookies and choose Never,'From 

visited,' or Always. 
A cookie is a piece of data that a website puts on iPhone so the website can 
remember you when you visit again. That way, webpages can be customized for you 
based on information you may have provided. 


Some pages won't work correctly unless iPhone is set to accept cookies. 


 
To clear all cookies from Safari, tap Clear Cookies. 
 
To clear the browser cache, tap Clear Cache. 
The browser cache stores the content of pages so the pages open faster the next 
time you visit them. If a page you open isn't showing new content, clearing the 
cache may help.

Tap iPod to listen to songs, audiobooks, and podcasts, 
and watch TV shows, movies, and other video. 


iPod on iPhone works . . . just like an iPod! iPhone syncs with iTunes on your computer 
to get the songs, movies, TV shows, and other content you've collected in your iTunes 
library. 

Syncing iPod Content from your iTunes Library 

If you've turned on syncing, iTunes automatically syncs content from iTunes library to 
iPhone each time you connect it to your computer. iTunes lets you sync all of your 
media, or selected songs, movies, videos, and podcasts. 

For information about syncing iPhone with your iTunes library, see 'Syncing iPhone 
with Your Computer' on page 5. 

For information about using iTunes to get music and other media onto your computer, 
open iTunes and choose Help > iTunes Help. 


Syncing Music, Podcasts, and Video 

Only songs and videos encoded in formats that iPhone supports are transferred to 

iPhone. For information about which formats iPhone supports, see page 111. 

If there are more songs in your iTunes library than can fit on your iPhone, iTunes asks if 
you want to create a special playlist and set it to sync with iPhone. Then iTunes 
randomly fills the playlist. You can add or delete songs from the playlist and sync again. 

When you sync podcasts or audiobooks on iPhone with those on your computer, both 
iTunes and iPhone remember where you last left off and start playing from that 
position. 

Transferring Purchased Content from iPhone to Another Computer 

Music, video, and podcasts sync from your iTunes library to iPhone, but not from 
iPhone to your iTunes library. However, you can transfer content purchased from the 
iTunes store from iPhone to an iTunes library on another computer. 

Connect iPhone to the other computer. iTunes asks if you want to transfer purchased 
content. You can also connect iPhone and, in iTunes, choose File > Transfer Purchases. 

To play the content, the computer must be authorized to play content from your iTunes 
account. 

Converting Videos for iPhone 

You can add videos other than those purchased from iTunes to iPhone, such as videos 
you create in iMovie on a Macintosh or videos you download from the Internet. 

If you try to add a video from iTunes to iPhone and a message says the video can't play 
on iPhone, you can convert the video. 

Convert a video to work with iPhone 

Select the video in your iTunes library and choose Advanced > 'Convert Selection for 
iPod.' Then add the converted video to iPhone. 

Playing Music and Video 

The high resolution display makes listening to songs on iPhone as much a visual 
experience as a musical one. You can scroll through your playlists, or use Cover Flow to 
browse through your album art. Videos play in landscape orientation to take full 
advantage of the widescreen display.

parts, except for the SIM card and SIM tray. If iPhone has been submerged 
in water, punctured, or subjected to a severe fall, do not use it until you take it to an 
authorized service provider. For service information, choose iPhone Help from the Help 
menu in iTunes or go to www.apple.com/support/iphone/service. The rechargeable 
battery in iPhone should be replaced only by an authorized service provider. For more 
information about batteries, go to www.apple.com/batteries. 


Charging iPhone 

To charge iPhone, only use the Apple Dock Connector to USB cable with an Apple USB 
Power Adapter or a high-power USB port on another device that is compliant with the 
USB 2.0 or 1.1 standards, another Apple-branded product or accessory designed to 
work with iPhone, or a third-party accessory certified to use Apple's 'Works with 
iPhone' logo. 


Read all safety instructions for any products and accessories before using with iPhone. 
Apple is not responsible for the operation of third-party accessories or their compliance 
with safety and regulatory standards. 


When you use the Apple USB Power Adapter to charge iPhone, make sure that the 
power adapter is fully assembled before you plug it into a power outlet. Then insert the 
Apple USB Power Adapter firmly into the power outlet. Do not connect or disconnect 
the Apple USB Power Adapter with wet hands. Do not use any power adapter other 
than the Apple USB Power Adapter to charge iPhone. 


The Apple USB Power Adapter may become warm during normal use. Always allow 
adequate ventilation around the Apple USB Power Adapter and use care when

You want to clean the adapter. 


Avoiding Hearing Damage 

Permanent hearing loss may occur if the receiver, earbuds, headphones, speakerphone, 
or earpieces are used at high volume. Set the volume to a safe level. You can adapt over 
time to a higher volume of sound that may sound normal but can be damaging to your 
hearing. If you experience ringing in your ears or muffled speech, stop listening and 
have your hearing checked. The louder the volume, the less time is required before 
your hearing could be affected. Hearing experts suggest that to protect your hearing: 

 
Limit the amount of time you use the receiver, earbuds, headphones, speakerphone, 

or earpieces at high volume. 
 
Avoid turning up the volume to block out noisy surroundings. 
 
Turn the volume down if you can't hear people speaking near you. 
For information about how to set a maximum volume limit on iPhone, see page 65. 

Appendix A Safety and Handling 

Driving Safely 

Use of iPhone and headphones (even if used in only one ear) while driving a vehicle or riding a bicycle is not recommended and is illegal in some areas. Check and obey the laws and regulations on the use of mobile devices like iPhone in the areas where you drive. Be careful and attentive while driving. If you decide to use iPhone while driving 
or riding a bicycle, keep in mind the following guidelines:

1 
Give full attention to driving and to the road. Using a mobile device while driving may be distracting. If you find it disruptive or distracting while operating any type of vehicle, riding a bicycle, or performing any activity that requires your full attention, pull off the road and park before making or answering a call if driving conditions require.

Get to know iPhone and its features such as favorites, recents, and speakerphone. 

These features help you to place your call without taking your attention off the road. 
See Chapter 3,'Phone,' on page 24 for more information. 

 
Use a hands-free device. Add an extra layer of convenience and safety to your iPhone with one of the many hands-free accessories available. 

 
Position iPhone within easy reach. Keep your eyes on the road. If you get an incoming call at an inconvenient time, let your voicemail answer it for you. 

 
Assess the traffic before dialing, or place calls when you are not moving or before pulling into traffic. Try to plan calls when your car will be stationary. Never dial or enter other text while you are driving. 

 
Let the person you are speaking with know you are driving. If necessary, suspend the call in heavy traffic or hazardous weather conditions. Driving in rain, sleet, snow, ice, fog, and even heavy traffic can be hazardous. 

 
Do not take notes, look up phone numbers, or perform any other activities that require your attention while driving. Jotting down a to-do list or flipping through your address book takes attention away from your primary responsibility, 
driving safely. 

 
Do not engage in stressful or emotional conversations that may be distracting. 

Make people you are talking with aware you are driving and suspend conversations 

that have the potential to divert your attention from the road. 

Avoiding Eyestrain 

When watching video or reading text on iPhone, avoid prolonged use and take breaks to prevent eyestrain. 

1. Adapted from the CTIA-The Wireless Association - Safe Driving Tips. 
Appendix A Safety and Handling 


Glass Parts 

The outside cover of the iPhone screen is made of glass. This glass could break if iPhone is dropped on a hard surface or receives a substantial impact. If the glass chips or cracks, do not touch or attempt to remove the broken glass. Stop using iPhone until the glass is replaced by an authorized service provider. For service information, choose 
iPhone Help from the Help menu in iTunes or go to www.apple.com/support/iphone/service. Glass cracked due to misuse or abuse is not covered under the warranty. 

Choking Hazards 

iPhone contains small parts, which may present a choking hazard to small children. 
Keep iPhone and its accessories away from small children. 

Repetitive Motion 

When you perform repetitive activities such as typing on iPhone, you may experience occasional discomfort in your hands, arms, shoulders, neck, or other parts of your body. 
If you continue to have discomfort during or after such use, stop use and see a physician. 

Potentially Explosive Atmospheres 

Turn off iPhone (press and hold the Sleep/Wake button, and then drag the onscreen red slider) when in any area with a potentially explosive atmosphere. Do not charge iPhone, and obey all signs and instructions. Sparks in such areas could cause an explosion or fire, resulting in serious injury or even death. 

Areas with a potentially explosive atmosphere are often, but not always, marked clearly. 
Potential areas may include: fueling areas (such as gas stations); below deck on boats; fuel or chemical transfer or storage facilities; vehicles using liquefied petroleum gas (such as propane or butane); areas where the air contains chemicals or particles (such as grain, dust, or metal powders); and any other area where you would normally be advised to turn off your vehicle engine. 

For Vehicles Equipped with an Air Bag 

An air bag inflates with great force. Do not store iPhone or any of its accessories in the area over the air bag or in the air bag deployment area. 

Appendix A Safety and Handling 


Exposure to Radio Frequency Energy 

iPhone contains radio transmitters and receivers. When on, iPhone receives and sends out radio frequency (RF) energy through its antenna. The iPhone antenna is located on the back of iPhone near the dock connector. iPhone is designed and manufactured not to exceed limits for exposure to RF energy set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of the United States. The exposure standard employs a unit of measurement known as the specific absorption rate, or SAR. The SAR limit applicable to iPhone set by the FCC is 1.6 watts per kilogram (W/kg).Tests for SAR are conducted using standard operating positions (i.e., at the ear and worn on the body) specified by the FCC with iPhone transmitting at its highest certified power level in all tested frequency bands. Although SAR is determined at the highest certified power level, the actual SAR level of iPhone while in operation can be well below the maximum value because iPhone adjusts its cellular transmitting power based in part on proximity to the wireless network. In general, the closer you are to a cellular base station, the lower the cellular transmitting power level. 

iPhone has been tested,1 and meets the FCC RF exposure guidelines for cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth operation. When tested for use at the ear, iPhone's highest SAR value is 0.974 W/kg. When tested for body-worn operation, with iPhone positioned 5/8 inch (15 mm) from the body, iPhone's highest SAR value is 0.694 W/kg. For body-worn operation, iPhone's SAR measurement may exceed the FCC exposure guidelines if positioned less than 5/8 inch (15 mm) from the body. For optimal mobile device performance and to be sure that human exposure to RF energy does not exceed the FCC guidelines, always follow these instructions and precautions: When on a call using the built-in audio receiver in iPhone, hold iPhone with the 30-pin connector pointed down toward your shoulder to increase separation from the antenna. For body-worn operation, keep iPhone at least 5/8 inch (15 mm) away from the body, and only use carrying cases, belt clips, or holders that do not have metal parts and that maintain at least 5/8 inch (15 mm) separation between iPhone and the body. When using the EDGE data transmission feature of iPhone (see 'Connecting to the Internet' on page 21 for 
more information), position iPhone's antenna at least 5/8 inch (15 mm) from the body. 
If you are still concerned about exposure to RF energy, you can further limit your exposure by limiting the amount of time using iPhone, since time is a factor in how much exposure a person receives, and by placing more distance between your body and iPhone, since exposure level drops off dramatically with distance. 

1. The device was tested by an accredited laboratory according to measurement standards and procedures specified in 
FCC OET Bulletin 65, Supplement C (Edition 01-01) and IEEE P1528.1, April 21 2003. 
Appendix A Safety and Handling 


Additional Information 

For more information from the FCC about exposure to RF energy, see: 
www.fcc.gov/oet/rfsafety 

The FCC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also maintain a consumer website at www.fda.gov/cellphones to address inquiries about the safety of mobile phones. Please check the website periodically for updates. 

For information about the scientific research related to RF energy exposure, see the EMF Research Database maintained by the World Health Organization at: 
www.who.int/emf 

Radio Frequency Interference 

Nearly every electronic device is subject to radio frequency interference from external sources if inadequately shielded or designed, or otherwise not configured to be compatible. As a result, iPhone may cause interference with other devices. Follow these instructions to avoid interference problems. 

Aircraft 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations may prohibit using wireless devices while in the air. For more information about using airplane mode to turn off the iPhone wireless transmitters, see 'Using iPhone on an Airplane' on page 22. 

Vehicles 

RF signals may affect installed or inadequately shielded electronic systems in motor vehicles. Check with the manufacturer or its representative regarding your vehicle. 

Electronic Devices 

Most modern electronic equipment is shielded from RF signals. However, certain electronic equipment may not be shielded against the RF signals from iPhone. 

Pacemakers 

The Health Industry Manufacturers Association recommends that a minimum separation of 6 inches (15 cm) be maintained between a handheld wireless phone and a pacemaker to avoid potential interference with the pacemaker. Persons with 
pacemakers: 

 
Should always keep iPhone more than six inches from their pacemaker when the phone is turned on 
 
Should not carry iPhone in a breast pocket
Should use the ear opposite the pacemaker to minimize the potential for interference 

If you have any reason to suspect that interference is taking place, turn off iPhone immediately. 

Appendix A Safety and Handling 

Hearing Aids 

iPhone may interfere with some hearing aids. If it does, consult the hearing aid manufacturer or your physician for alternatives or remedies. 

Other Medical Devices 

If you use any other personal medical device, consult the device manufacturer or your physician to determine if it is adequately shielded from external RF energy. 

Turn off iPhone in health care facilities when any regulations posted in these areas instruct you to do so. Hospitals and health care facilities may use equipment that is sensitive to external RF energy. 

Posted Facilities 

Turn off iPhone in any facility where posted notices so require. 

Blasting Areas 

To avoid interfering with blasting operations, turn off iPhone when in a 'blasting area' or in areas posted 'Turn off two-way radio.' Obey all signs and instructions. 

Emergency Calls 

You should not rely on wireless devices for essential communications, such as medical emergencies. Use of iPhone to call emergency services, for example by dialing 911, may not work in all locations. Emergency numbers and services vary by region, and sometimes an emergency call cannot be placed due to network availability or 
environmental interference. 

Important Handling Information 

NOTICE: Failure to follow these handling instructions could result in damage to iPhone or other property. 

Carrying iPhone 

iPhone contains sensitive components. Do not bend, drop, or crush iPhone. If you are concerned about scratching iPhone, you can use one of the many cases sold separately. 

Using Connectors and Ports 

Never force a connector into a port. Check for obstructions on the port. If the 
connector and port don't join with reasonable ease, they probably don't match. Make 
sure that the connector matches the port and that you have positioned the connector 
correctly in relation to the port. 

Appendix A Safety and Handling 


Keeping iPhone Within Acceptable Temperatures 

Operate iPhone in a place where the temperature is always between 0' and 35' C (32' to 95' F). Battery life might temporarily shorten in low-temperature conditions.

AA (audible.com spoken word, formats 2, 3, and 4) 
 
AIFF 

The following video file formats are supported by iPhone: 
 
H.264 (Baseline Profile Level 3.0) 
 
MPEG-4 (Simple Profile) 


A song encoded using Apple Lossless format has full CD-quality sound, but takes up only about half as much space as a song encoded using AIFF or WAV format. The same song encoded in AAC or MP3 format takes up even less space. When you import music from a CD using iTunes, it is converted to AAC format by default. 

Using iTunes for Windows, you can convert nonprotected WMA files to AAC or MP3 format. This can be useful if you have a library of music encoded in WMA format. 

iPhone does not support WMA, MPEG Layer 1, MPEG Layer 2 audio files, or audible.com format 1. 

If you have a song or video in your iTunes library that isn't supported by iPhone, you may be able to convert it to a format iPhone supports. See iTunes Help for more 
information. 


If you can't open an attachment in an email 

The file type may not be supported. iPhone supports the following email attachment file formats: 
 
.c, .cpp, .diff, .doc, .docx, .h, .hpp, .htm, .html, .m, .mm, .patch, .pdf, .txt, .xls, .xlsx 

If email couldn't be delivered because the connection to the server on port 25 
timed out 

You may need to change the port setting on an outgoing mail server for one of your email accounts. For information, go to www.apple.com/support/iphone and search for 'I can receive email on iPhone but can't send it.' 

If you can't remember your passcode 

You must restore the iPhone software. See 'Updating and Restoring iPhone Software' 
on page 114. 

If you entered data on iPhone that you don't want to sync to your computer 

Replace contacts, calendars, mail accounts, or bookmarks on iPhone with information from your computer. 


Open iTunes. 
As you connect iPhone to your computer, press and hold Command-Option (if you're 
using a Mac) or Shift-Control (if you're using a PC) until you see iPhone in the iTunes 
Source pane. This prevents iPhone from syncing automatically. 


Appendix B Tips and Troubleshooting 


3 
Select iPhone in the iTunes Source pane and click the Info tab. 

4 
Under 'Replace information on this iPhone,' select Contacts, Calendars, Mail Accounts, 
or Bookmarks. You can select more than one, if you like. 

5 
Click Apply. 
Data of the selected type is erased from iPhone and replaced with what's on your 
computer. The next time you sync, iPhone syncs normally, adding data you've entered 
on iPhone to your computer, and vice versa. 

If you can't sync with Yahoo! Address Book 

iTunes may not be able to connect with Yahoo!. Make sure you are connected to the 
Internet, and that you've entered the correct Yahoo! ID and password in iTunes. 
Connect iPhone to your computer, click the Info tab in iTunes, click Configure in the 
Contacts section, then enter your current Yahoo! ID and password. 

If contacts you deleted on iPhone or your computer are not removed from Yahoo! 

Address Book after syncing 

Yahoo! Address Book does not allow contacts containing a Messenger ID to be deleted 
through syncing. To delete a contact containing a Messenger ID, log in to your Yahoo! 
account online and delete the contact using Yahoo! Address Book. 

If you can't make a call or send a text message over Wi-Fi 

iPhone doesn't support calling or texting over Wi-Fi. 

Removing the SIM Card 

If you need to send your iPhone in for service or if you want to loan your iPhone to 
someone and you still want to be able to make calls, you may be able to use the SIM 
card inside iPhone with another GSM phone. 

Remove the SIM card 

Insert the end of a small paper clip into the hole on the SIM tray. Press firmly and push 
it straight in until the tray pops out.

Updating and Restoring iPhone Software 

You can use iTunes to update or restore iPod software. You should always update 
iPhone to use the latest software. You can also restore the software, which puts iPhone 
back to its original state. 
 
If you update, the iPhone software is updated but your settings and songs are not 

affected. 

If you restore, all data is erased from iPhone, including songs, videos, contacts, photos, 

calendar information, and any other data. All iPhone settings are restored to their 

original state. 

Update or restore iPhone 

Make sure you have an Internet connection and have installed the latest version of 
iTunes from www.apple.com/itunes. 
Connect iPhone to your computer. 


In iTunes, select iPhone in the Source pane and click the Summary tab. 
Click 'Check for Update.' iTunes tells you if there's a newer version of the iPhone 
software available. 


Click Update to install the latest version of the software. Or click Restore to restore 
iPhone to its original settings and erase all data on iPhone. Follow the onscreen 
instructions to complete the restore process. 


Using iPhone Accessibility Features 

The following features may make it easier for you to use iPhone if you have a disability. 

TTY support 

Use iPhone in TTY mode with the iPhone TTY Adapter (available separately) to use a 
Teletype (TTY) machine. See 'Using iPhone with a Teletype (TTY) Machine' on page 35. 

Minimum font size for Mail messages 

Set a minimum font size for Mail message text to Large, Extra Large, or Giant to 
increase readability. See 'Set a minimum font size for messages' on page 50. 

Large keypad 

Make phone calls simply by tapping entries in your contacts and favorites lists. When 
you need to dial a number, iPhone's large numeric keypad makes it easy. See 'Dial a 
call' on page 25. 

Zooming 

Double-tap or pinch webpages, photos, and maps to zoom in. See page 17. 

Appendix B Tips and Troubleshooting 


Visual voicemail 

The play and pause controls in visual voicemail let you control the playback of 
messages. Drag the playhead on the scrubber bar to repeat a portion of the message 
that is hard to understand. See 'Listen to a new voicemail message' on page 30. 

Universal Access in Mac OS X 

Take advantage of the Universal Access features in Mac OS X when you use iTunes to 
sync information and content from your iTunes library to iPhone. In the Finder, choose 
Help > Mac Help, then search for 'universal access.' 

For more information about iPhone and Mac OS X accessibility features, go to:
